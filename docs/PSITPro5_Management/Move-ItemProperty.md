# Move-ItemProperty

## SYNOPSIS
Moves a property from one location to another.

## DESCRIPTION
The Move-ItemProperty cmdlet moves a property of an item from one item to another item.
For example, it can move a registry entry from one registry key to another registry key.
When you move an item property, it is added to the new location and deleted from its original location.

## PARAMETERS

### Credential [PSCredential]

```powershell
[Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true)]
```

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01", or enter a PSCredential object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.


### Destination [String]

```powershell
[Parameter(
  Mandatory = $true,
  Position = 2,
  ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true)]
```

Specifies the path to the destination location.


### Exclude [String[]]

Omits the specified items.
The value of this parameter qualifies the Path parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt".
Wildcards are permitted.


### Filter [String]

Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
The value of this parameter qualifies the Path parameter.
The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when retrieving the objects rather than having Windows PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.


### Force [switch]

Allows the cmdlet to move properties to or from items that cannot otherwise be accessed by the user.
Implementation varies from provider to provider.
For more information, see about_Providers.


### Include [String[]]

Moves only the specified items.
The value of this parameter qualifies the Path parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt".
Wildcards are permitted.


### InformationAction [System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference]

```powershell
[ValidateSet(
  'SilentlyContinue',
  'Stop',
  'Continue',
  'Inquire',
  'Ignore',
  'Suspend')]
```


Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01", or enter a PSCredential object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.


### InformationVariable [System.String]


Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01", or enter a PSCredential object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.


### LiteralPath [String[]]

```powershell
[Parameter(
  Mandatory = $true,
  ParameterSetName = 'Set 2')]
```

Specifies the path to the current location of the property.
Unlike Path, the value of LiteralPath is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell Windows PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.


### Name [String[]]

```powershell
[Parameter(
  Mandatory = $true,
  Position = 3,
  ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true)]
```

Specifies the name of the property to be moved.


### PassThru [switch]

Passes an object representing the item property.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.


### Path [String[]]

```powershell
[Parameter(
  Mandatory = $true,
  Position = 1,
  ValueFromPipeline = $true,
  ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true,
  ParameterSetName = 'Set 1')]
```

Specifies the path to the current location of the property.
Wildcards are permitted.


### Confirm [switch]

## INPUTS
### System.String

## OUTPUTS

When you use the PassThru parameter, Move-ItemProperty generates a PSCustomObject representing the moved item property.
Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
The names of the Path, Destination, and Name parameters are optional.
If you omit the parameter names, the unnamed parameter values must appear in this order: Path, Destination, Name.
If you include the parameter names, the parameters can appear in any order.

You can also refer to Move-ItemProperty by its built-in alias, "mp".
For more information, see about_Aliases.

The Move-ItemProperty cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider.
To list the providers available in your session, type "Get-PSProvider".
For more information, see about_Providers.
